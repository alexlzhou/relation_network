## Relation Network

This is an implementation of relation network (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.06025.pdf) using only PyTorch libraries.

A relation network compares two feature maps and output a score based on how similar the two feature maps are... From my understanding so far. More to come.

5 input to 1 base, concatenate feature maps and use mean square error to calculate loss.
